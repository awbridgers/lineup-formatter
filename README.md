## Lineup Formatter
A simple app to get lineup info for basketball games provided by LiveStats and format it for use with the [lineup-boxscore-tracker](https://github.com/awbridgers/lineup-boxscore-tracker). Using this saves a ton of time from trying to input lineup information manually (which requires watching the entire game and trying to keep up substitutions).

This app can be found live [here](https://awbridgers.github.io/lineup-formatter/).

### How to use
1. Find the lineup data in the LiveStats PDF boxscore. It is typically found on page 18 or 19, right under the shot charts.
2. Copy the lineup table, which looks like this:

3. Paste the data into the textbox and click *Submit*.
4. If the data succesfully parses, a *Download* button will appear that will save the data as an excel sheet.
5. This file can be then be uploaded to the boxscore-tracker.
